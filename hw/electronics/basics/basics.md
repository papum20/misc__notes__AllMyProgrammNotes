# BASICS

## MEASUERS
`1A` : **ampere** - quantity of (electric) charge, passing through  
`1V` : **volt** - ?  
`1W` : **watt** - power, i.e. energy in a certain amount of time
*	`1W=1J/s`

`1Ah` : **ampere-hour** - quantity of charge, flowing through a body, for one hour
*	`Ah=A*h`

`1Wh` **watt-hour** - 1W expanded for one hour of time  


## FORMULAS
`W=AV` :  

`h=(Ah)/A` : time for a charge of `X Ah` to flow by `Y A` at a time  
`h=(Wh)/W` :  
`Ah=(Wh)/V` equals `A*h=(A*V*h)/V` : `Wh` behaves like `W` times `h`
