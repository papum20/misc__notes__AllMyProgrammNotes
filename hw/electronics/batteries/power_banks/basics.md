# BASICS

It's a battery.  

## (USUAL) DATA
`3.7V` : typical voltage  

## CAPACITY
1.	`Ah` differs at different `V`
	*	ref: see hw/batteries
	*	e.g.: `20.000mAh` are indicated for `3.7V`, but using the power bank at `5V`, its capacity is `(20Ah)*(3.7V)/(5V)=(20*3.7Wh)/5V=16.800mAh`
2.	There's always some loss, mostly from conversion between different tensions and from the heat produced in the circuits
	*	the loss produces heat
	*	thus, some say that a power bank which heats less is more efficient
		*	PPS : a technology allowing a wider range of A/V combinations in PD charges
			*	this reduces heat, thus increasing efficiency
3.	Usually: real capacity (usable, already at phone's voltage) is `60-80%`, typically around `70%`
	*	so, below it's a bad power bank, above is good

## WEIGHT
There's no excuse, charge requires weight.  
Usually: `200g per 10.000mAh` (at `3.7V`).  
*	below means the real capacity is probably much worse, above is bulkier, but maybe reassuring.
*	note: i don't know if there are some new technilogies which allow less weights.
