# BASICS

## INSTALL

Sometimes (like in some docker containers) `apt` won't find stuff like `ss`: install `net-tools` :  
```bash
apt install net-tools
```

## SSH

`ssh` : command to connect "with a secure shell" (from your machine)  
`sshd` : ssh demon - concerns received ssh connections (on your machine)
