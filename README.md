# All My Programm Notes
The external hard-drive of my programming-and-computer-related knowledge.
Here you can find tons of commands, shortcuts, tips and all that stuff which I either forget repeatedly, or can't remember because I only use them once in a while.

## STRUCTURE
In each folder, named as the topic, you can find a list of markdown notes.
Folders can be grouped by topic.

root 
	subdir1

			README.md  

## GENERAL SYNTAX
