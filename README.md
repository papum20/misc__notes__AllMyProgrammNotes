# All My Programm Notes
The external hard-drive of my programming-and-computer-related knowledge.
Here you can find tons of commands, shortcuts, tips and all that stuff which I either forget repeatedly, or can't remember because I only use them once in a while.

## STRUCTURE
In each folder, named as the topic, you can find a list of markdown notes.
Folders can be grouped by topic.

- `root` 
	- `subdir1`  
		- `topic1`  
			- `file1.md`  
			- `file2.md`  
			- `README.md`  

## GENERAL SYNTAX

	`command ARGUMENT(S)` : notes  
	- command  
	- parameters names: uppercase
	- colon (`:`) separates command from notes
